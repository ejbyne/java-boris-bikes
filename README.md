# Java Boris Bikes

## Summary

To help me get more familiar with TDD and OOP in Java, I decided to recreated the [Boris Bikes project](https://github.com/ejbyne/boris-bikes) that I previously built in Ruby.

This was a very good exercise in getting used to JUnit, including creating mock objects using Mockito, and more generally improving my Java knowledge.

## Technologies used

- Java
- JUnit
- Mockito
- Gradle
